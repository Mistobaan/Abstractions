# Entity Component System Implementation: Practical Goal-Directed Typed Processes

*A production-ready implementation of information-theoretic agent architectures through versioned entity management and callable registries*

## 1. From Theory to Implementation

The Goal-Directed Typed Processes framework provides the theoretical foundation for building reliable, goal-oriented AI agents. This document presents a **concrete implementation** of that framework through an Entity Component System (ECS) combined with a Callable Registry architecture.

**Core Insight**: Instead of building abstract categorical structures, we implement the information-theoretic principles through **practical software engineering patterns** that naturally enforce the constraints we need:

- **Entity Component System** → Memory Stack with perfect provenance
- **Callable Registry** → Process execution with automatic tracing
- **Entity References** → Pointer-only composition with type safety
- **Automatic Versioning** → Information gain measurement and monotonic growth

This implementation eliminates hallucination not through complex type theory, but through **engineered impossibility** - the system literally cannot generate information that doesn't exist.

## 2. Entity Component System: The Information Substrate

### 2.1 Entities as Information Containers

An **Entity** in our system is fundamentally an **information container** with strict versioning and provenance tracking. Unlike traditional ECS implementations focused on performance, our design prioritizes **information integrity** and **causal traceability**.

**Core Entity Architecture**:
```python
class Entity(BaseModel):
    ecs_id: UUID                    # Permanent identity
    live_id: UUID                   # Runtime working reference
    lineage_id: UUID                # Tracks related versions
    root_ecs_id: Optional[UUID]     # Tree structure reference
    root_live_id: Optional[UUID]    # Current tree reference
    attribute_source: Dict[str, UUID]  # Information provenance
    created_at: datetime            # Temporal tracking
    forked_at: Optional[datetime]   # Version creation time
```

**Information-Theoretic Properties**:

**Immutability Through Versioning**: Once created, entities never change. All modifications create new versions with updated `ecs_id` values. This ensures that information content is **conserved** - we can only add information, never lose it.

**Dual Identity System**: The `ecs_id` provides **permanent addressing** for stored information, while `live_id` enables **runtime navigation**. This separation allows the same logical entity to exist in multiple computational contexts without confusion.

**Provenance Tracking**: The `attribute_source` field creates a **causal graph** of information flow. Every piece of data tracks which entities contributed to its creation, enabling precise credit assignment for learning algorithms.

**Example Information Flow**:
```python
# Initial entity with raw data
customer_data = Entity(
    ecs_id=uuid4(),
    untyped_data="customer_records.csv",
    attribute_source={"untyped_data": None}  # Source: external input
)

# Processed entity with tracked provenance
customer_analysis = Entity(
    ecs_id=uuid4(),
    segment_classification="high_value",
    confidence_score=0.87,
    attribute_source={
        "segment_classification": customer_data.ecs_id,    # Derived from customer_data
        "confidence_score": analysis_algorithm.ecs_id      # Using specific algorithm
    }
)
```

### 2.2 Entity Trees: Hierarchical Information Organization

The **EntityTree** structure provides the **compositional foundation** for complex information relationships. Rather than flat storage, information is organized in **directed acyclic graphs** that preserve structural relationships.

**Tree Architecture**:
```python
class EntityTree(BaseModel):
    root_ecs_id: UUID                                    # Tree root identifier
    nodes: Dict[UUID, Entity]                           # All entities in tree
    edges: Dict[Tuple[UUID, UUID], EntityEdge]         # Relationships between entities
    ancestry_paths: Dict[UUID, List[UUID]]             # Navigation paths
    live_id_to_ecs_id: Dict[UUID, UUID]               # Runtime resolution
```

**Relationship Types**:

**Direct Edges**: Simple field references between entities
```python
# customer.primary_address → address_entity
EntityEdge(
    source_id=customer.ecs_id,
    target_id=address.ecs_id,
    edge_type=EdgeType.DIRECT,
    field_name="primary_address"
)
```

**Container Edges**: References within lists, dictionaries, sets, or tuples
```python
# customer.order_history[2] → specific_order_entity
EntityEdge(
    source_id=customer.ecs_id,
    target_id=order.ecs_id,
    edge_type=EdgeType.LIST,
    field_name="order_history",
    container_index=2
)
```

**Hierarchical Edges**: Primary ownership relationships that define tree structure
```python
# Mark the main parent-child relationship
tree.mark_edge_as_hierarchical(parent.ecs_id, child.ecs_id)
```

**Information-Theoretic Navigation**: The tree structure enables **efficient traversal** of related information. Ancestry paths provide **shortest-path routing** for information access, while hierarchical edges define **primary causal relationships**.

**Structural Properties**:

**Acyclic Constraint**: No circular references are permitted, ensuring that information dependencies form a **directed acyclic graph**. This prevents infinite loops and enables **topological processing** of information updates.

**Ancestry Tracking**: Every entity maintains a **complete path** to the tree root, enabling fast **lineage queries** and **impact analysis** when information changes.

**Efficient Querying**: The dual indexing system (outgoing/incoming edges) allows **bidirectional traversal** - find all entities referenced by X, or find all entities that reference X.

### 2.3 Entity Registry: Global Information Coordination

The **EntityRegistry** serves as the **global coordination layer** for all information in the system. It maintains multiple indexes to enable efficient access patterns while preserving versioning constraints.

**Registry Architecture**:
```python
class EntityRegistry:
    tree_registry: Dict[UUID, EntityTree]              # root_ecs_id → complete tree
    lineage_registry: Dict[UUID, List[UUID]]          # lineage_id → version history
    live_id_registry: Dict[UUID, Entity]              # live_id → current entity
    type_registry: Dict[Type[Entity], List[UUID]]     # entity_type → lineage_ids
```

**Information Management Functions**:

**Version Control**: When entities change, the registry **automatically manages versioning**:
```python
def version_entity(self, entity: Entity) -> bool:
    old_tree = self.get_stored_tree(entity.root_ecs_id)
    new_tree = build_entity_tree(entity)

    # Detect actual information changes
    modified_entities = find_modified_entities(new_tree, old_tree)

    # Only version if real changes occurred
    if modified_entities:
        # Update ecs_ids for changed entities
        # Preserve lineage relationships
        # Register new tree version
        return True
    return False
```

**Change Detection**: The system automatically identifies **genuine information changes** versus superficial modifications:
```python
def find_modified_entities(new_tree: EntityTree, old_tree: EntityTree) -> Set[UUID]:
    # Compare node sets (added/removed entities)
    # Compare edge sets (moved entities)
    # Compare attributes (modified content)
    # Return entities that actually gained information
```

**Live/Storage Separation**: The registry maintains **dual-mode access**:
- **Live entities**: Current working objects with `live_id` references
- **Stored entities**: Immutable snapshots indexed by `ecs_id`

This separation enables **concurrent access** without interference while guaranteeing **reproducible retrieval** of any historical state.

## 3. Callable Registry: Process Execution Architecture

### 3.1 Callables as Typed Processes

The **CallableRegistry** implements the Process Registry from our theoretical framework. Each registered function represents a **Typed Process** that can transform information while maintaining strict provenance and type safety.

**Process Registration**:
```python
@CallableRegistry.register("analyze_customer_segments")
def segment_analysis(
    customer_data: str,           # Input type constraint
    segmentation_method: str,     # Input type constraint
    confidence_threshold: float   # Input type constraint
) -> Entity:                     # Output type guarantee
    # Process logic with automatic entity tracing
    # Input validation ensures type safety
    # Output entity creation with provenance tracking
```

**Automatic Process Enhancement**: Every registered callable is **automatically wrapped** with entity tracing capabilities:
```python
def register(cls, name: str):
    def decorator(func):
        # Apply automatic entity tracing
        traced_func = entity_tracer(func)
        cls._registry[name] = traced_func
        return traced_func
    return decorator
```

**Information-Theoretic Process Properties**:

**Input Constructibility**: Processes can only execute if their inputs can be **constructed from available entities**. This implements the constructibility constraint from our theoretical framework.

**Output Novelty**: Processes are expected to produce **new information types** or **enhanced information content**. The entity versioning system automatically detects and tracks these additions.

**Provenance Preservation**: All process executions automatically **track information lineage** through the `attribute_source` mechanism, creating a complete audit trail of computational steps.

### 3.2 Entity References: Pointer-Only Composition

The **entity reference system** implements the critical "no hallucination" constraint through a **pointer-only composition mechanism**. Instead of allowing free-form parameter generation, all process inputs must be **explicit references** to existing entities.

**Reference Syntax**:
```python
# Execution with entity references
execute_callable("analyze_customer_segments", {
    "customer_data": "@f65cf3bd-9392-499f-8f57-dba701f5069c.csv_content",
    "segmentation_method": "@a1b2c3d4-5678-90ef-1234-567890abcdef.algorithm_name",
    "confidence_threshold": 0.85  # Direct values still allowed for primitives
})
```

**Reference Resolution Process**:

**1. Parse Reference**: Extract UUID and attribute path from `@uuid.field.subfield` syntax
```python
def parse_entity_reference(ref_string: str) -> Tuple[UUID, str]:
    # "@f65cf3bd-9392-499f-8f57-dba701f5069c.csv_content"
    # → (UUID("f65cf3bd..."), "csv_content")
```

**2. Entity Retrieval**: Fetch entity from registry with existence validation
```python
def fetch_entity(entity_id: UUID) -> Entity:
    entity = EntityRegistry.get_live_entity(entity_id)
    if entity is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Entity {entity_id} not found")
    return entity
```

**3. Attribute Navigation**: Traverse field path with type checking
```python
def navigate_attribute_path(entity: Entity, path: str) -> Any:
    # Handle nested field access: "user_data.financial_info.credit_score"
    current_value = entity
    for field_name in path.split('.'):
        current_value = getattr(current_value, field_name)
    return current_value
```

**4. Type Validation**: Ensure resolved value matches expected parameter type
```python
def validate_resolved_input(value: Any, expected_type: Type) -> Any:
    # Use Pydantic validation to ensure type safety
    # Raise descriptive errors for type mismatches
```

**Anti-Hallucination Mechanism**: This system makes hallucination **physically impossible**:
- **Cannot reference non-existent entities**: UUID must exist in registry
- **Cannot access non-existent fields**: Attribute path must be valid
- **Cannot bypass type checking**: Pydantic validation enforces contracts
- **Cannot fabricate data**: All information must have traceable provenance

### 3.3 Automatic Entity Tracing: Information Gain Detection

The **entity tracing system** automatically detects information changes during process execution, implementing the information gain measurement from our theoretical framework.

**Tracing Mechanism**:
```python
def entity_tracer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # 1. Pre-execution entity state capture
        input_entities = extract_entities_from_args(args, kwargs)
        pre_execution_snapshots = capture_entity_states(input_entities)

        # 2. Function execution
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        # 3. Post-execution change detection
        post_execution_states = capture_entity_states(input_entities)
        changed_entities = detect_changes(pre_execution_snapshots, post_execution_states)

        # 4. Automatic versioning for changed entities
        for entity in changed_entities:
            EntityRegistry.version_entity(entity)

        # 5. Result entity registration
        if isinstance(result, Entity):
            EntityRegistry.register_entity(result)

        return result
    return wrapper
```

**Change Detection Algorithm**:

**State Capture**: Before and after execution, capture complete entity states
```python
def capture_entity_states(entities: List[Entity]) -> Dict[UUID, EntitySnapshot]:
    snapshots = {}
    for entity in entities:
        snapshots[entity.ecs_id] = EntitySnapshot(
            attribute_values=get_non_entity_attributes(entity),
            structure_hash=compute_structure_hash(entity),
            timestamp=datetime.now()
        )
    return snapshots
```

**Structural Comparison**: Detect changes in entity attributes and relationships
```python
def detect_changes(before: Dict[UUID, EntitySnapshot],
                  after: Dict[UUID, EntitySnapshot]) -> List[Entity]:
    changed_entities = []
    for entity_id in before.keys():
        if before[entity_id].structure_hash != after[entity_id].structure_hash:
            changed_entities.append(get_entity(entity_id))
    return changed_entities
```

**Information Content Analysis**: Measure actual information gain from changes
```python
def calculate_information_gain(old_entity: Entity, new_entity: Entity) -> float:
    old_entropy = calculate_entity_entropy(old_entity)
    new_entropy = calculate_entity_entropy(new_entity)
    return new_entropy - old_entropy  # Positive = information gained
```

**Automatic Versioning**: Create new entity versions only when **genuine information changes** occur, preserving lineage while avoiding unnecessary version proliferation.

## 4. Information Flow Architecture

### 4.1 End-to-End Information Processing

The complete system creates a **seamless information processing pipeline** that transforms uncertain goal states into achieved goal states through **principled information accumulation**.

**Processing Pipeline**:

**1. Goal Specification**: Define target information states
```python
goal = Goal(
    target_types={CustomerSegmentation, MarketInsights, RecommendationModel},
    success_condition=lambda entities: validate_complete_analysis(entities),
    entropy_threshold=0.1  # Acceptable remaining uncertainty
)
```

**2. Available Process Discovery**: Find callables whose inputs can be constructed
```python
def get_available_processes(current_entities: List[Entity]) -> List[str]:
    available = []
    for process_name, process_func in CallableRegistry.get_all():
        if can_construct_inputs(process_func, current_entities):
            available.append(process_name)
    return available
```

**3. Information Gain Estimation**: Predict value of each available process
```python
def estimate_process_information_gain(process_name: str,
                                    current_entities: List[Entity],
                                    goal: Goal) -> float:
    # Simulate process execution
    predicted_output = predict_process_output(process_name, current_entities)

    # Calculate entropy reduction
    current_entropy = calculate_goal_entropy(current_entities, goal)
    predicted_entropy = calculate_goal_entropy(current_entities + [predicted_output], goal)

    return current_entropy - predicted_entropy
```

**4. Process Selection**: Choose highest information gain process
```python
def select_optimal_process(available_processes: List[str],
                          current_entities: List[Entity],
                          goal: Goal) -> str:
    best_process = None
    best_gain = 0

    for process_name in available_processes:
        gain = estimate_process_information_gain(process_name, current_entities, goal)
        if gain > best_gain:
            best_gain = gain
            best_process = process_name

    return best_process
```

**5. Input Construction**: Build entity references for process execution
```python
def construct_process_inputs(process_name: str,
                           available_entities: List[Entity]) -> Dict[str, str]:
    signature = CallableRegistry.get_signature(process_name)
    inputs = {}

    for param_name, param_type in signature.parameters.items():
        # Find compatible entity
        compatible_entity = find_entity_with_type(param_type, available_entities)

        # Create entity reference
        inputs[param_name] = f"@{compatible_entity.ecs_id}.{get_appropriate_field(param_type)}"

    return inputs
```

**6. Process Execution**: Execute with automatic tracing and versioning
```python
def execute_information_gathering_step(process_name: str,
                                     inputs: Dict[str, str]) -> Entity:
    # CallableRegistry handles:
    # - Entity reference resolution
    # - Type validation
    # - Automatic tracing
    # - Provenance tracking
    # - Result registration
    return CallableRegistry.execute_callable(process_name, inputs)
```

### 4.2 Provenance-Driven Learning

The system's **complete provenance tracking** enables sophisticated learning mechanisms that improve process selection over time.

**Information Value Backpropagation**:
```python
def backpropagate_information_value(goal_achievement: Entity,
                                  execution_trace: List[ProcessStep]) -> None:
    # Calculate actual information contribution of each step
    for step in reversed(execution_trace):
        # How much did this step actually contribute to goal achievement?
        step.actual_information_value = calculate_mutual_information(
            step.output_entity, goal_achievement
        )

        # Update process value estimates
        update_process_value_estimate(
            step.process_name,
            step.input_context,
            step.actual_information_value
        )
```

**Process Selection Learning**:
```python
def update_process_selection_model(process_name: str,
                                 context: ProcessContext,
                                 actual_gain: float,
                                 predicted_gain: float) -> None:
    # Learn from prediction errors
    prediction_error = actual_gain - predicted_gain

    # Update model parameters
    process_value_model.update(
        process_name=process_name,
        context_features=extract_context_features(context),
        target_value=actual_gain,
        learning_rate=calculate_adaptive_learning_rate(prediction_error)
    )
```

**Transfer Learning**: Insights from one goal domain transfer to similar goals through **structural pattern recognition**:
```python
def extract_transferable_patterns(successful_execution: ExecutionTrace) -> List[Pattern]:
    patterns = []

    # Identify successful information flow patterns
    for window in sliding_window(successful_execution.steps, size=3):
        pattern = InformationFlowPattern(
            input_types=[step.input_types for step in window],
            process_sequence=[step.process_name for step in window],
            output_types=[step.output_type for step in window],
            information_gain=sum(step.actual_gain for step in window)
        )
        patterns.append(pattern)

    return patterns
```

## 5. Practical Implementation Architecture

### 5.1 System Components Integration

The complete system integrates multiple architectural layers to create a **robust, goal-directed information processing engine**.

**Component Interaction Flow**:

**Entity Management Layer**:
- **EntityRegistry**: Global information coordination
- **EntityTree**: Structural relationship management
- **Entity**: Individual information containers with versioning

**Process Execution Layer**:
- **CallableRegistry**: Process discovery and execution
- **Entity Tracer**: Automatic change detection and versioning
- **Reference Resolver**: Pointer-only input construction

**Goal-Direction Layer**:
- **Goal Specification**: Target information state definition
- **Process Selection**: Information gain-driven choice
- **Progress Tracking**: Entropy reduction measurement

**Learning Layer**:
- **Provenance Analysis**: Information value calculation
- **Model Updates**: Process selection improvement
- **Pattern Transfer**: Cross-domain knowledge sharing

### 5.2 Operational Characteristics

**Information Monotonicity**: The system guarantees that information content **never decreases**:
- Entity versioning preserves all historical states
- Process execution only adds new information
- Reference resolution prevents information fabrication

**Computational Efficiency**: Multiple optimization strategies ensure practical performance:
- **Lazy Tree Construction**: Entity trees built only when needed
- **Incremental Change Detection**: Only modified entities trigger versioning
- **Cached Process Selection**: Reuse successful process sequences

**Error Handling and Recovery**:
```python
def robust_process_execution(process_name: str, inputs: Dict[str, str]) -> Optional[Entity]:
    try:
        # Attempt normal execution
        return CallableRegistry.execute_callable(process_name, inputs)
    except EntityNotFoundError as e:
        # Handle missing entity references
        return handle_missing_entity(e.entity_id, process_name)
    except TypeValidationError as e:
        # Handle type mismatches
        return suggest_type_corrections(e.expected_type, e.actual_type)
    except ProcessExecutionError as e:
        # Handle process-specific failures
        return fallback_process_selection(process_name, inputs)
```

**Scalability Considerations**:
- **Distributed Entity Storage**: Registry can be distributed across multiple nodes
- **Parallel Process Execution**: Independent processes can run concurrently
- **Hierarchical Goal Decomposition**: Complex goals broken into manageable subgoals

### 5.3 Integration with Goal-Directed Navigation

The ECS implementation provides the **foundational substrate** for the hypergraph navigation described in the theoretical framework:

**State Space Representation**:
```python
class AgentState:
    def __init__(self, entity_registry: EntityRegistry):
        self.available_entities = entity_registry.get_all_live_entities()
        self.available_processes = CallableRegistry.get_available()
        self.goal_entropy = self.calculate_current_entropy()

    def get_successor_states(self) -> List['AgentState']:
        """Generate all possible next states through process execution"""
        successors = []

        for process_name in self.available_processes:
            if self.can_construct_inputs(process_name):
                # Simulate process execution
                new_state = self.simulate_process_execution(process_name)
                successors.append(new_state)

        return successors
```

**A* Search Implementation**:
```python
def find_optimal_goal_path(initial_state: AgentState, goal: Goal) -> List[ProcessStep]:
    frontier = PriorityQueue()
    frontier.put((0, initial_state, []))  # (f_score, state, path)

    explored = set()

    while not frontier.empty():
        f_score, current_state, path = frontier.get()

        if goal.success_condition(current_state.available_entities):
            return path  # Found solution

        if current_state.state_hash() in explored:
            continue

        explored.add(current_state.state_hash())

        for successor in current_state.get_successor_states():
            new_path = path + [successor.creation_step]
            g_score = len(new_path)  # Cost so far
            h_score = successor.goal_entropy  # Heuristic (remaining uncertainty)
            f_score = g_score + h_score

            frontier.put((f_score, successor, new_path))

    return []  # No solution found
```

## 6. Emergent Properties and Capabilities

### 6.1 Self-Organizing Information Architecture

The combination of entity versioning, provenance tracking, and process selection creates **emergent organizational properties**:

**Natural Information Hierarchies**: Entities automatically organize into **semantic hierarchies** based on information dependencies. More fundamental information (data sources, basic facts) naturally becomes the foundation for derived information (analyses, insights, recommendations).

**Adaptive Process Ecosystems**: The system develops **process usage patterns** that reflect the actual value of different computational approaches. Successful processes get selected more frequently, while ineffective processes are naturally filtered out.

**Information Quality Gradients**: Through repeated execution and learning, the system develops **implicit quality metrics** for different information sources and processing approaches, leading to improved decision-making over time.

### 6.2 Reliability and Safety Properties

**Hallucination Impossibility**: The entity reference system creates **structural impossibility** of hallucination:
- Cannot reference non-existent data (UUID must exist)
- Cannot fabricate field values (must traverse actual object structure)
- Cannot bypass type validation (Pydantic enforces contracts)
- Cannot lose information provenance (automatic tracking)

**Reproducible Computation**: Complete provenance tracking enables **perfect reproducibility**:
- Any result can be traced back to its information sources
- Process sequences can be replayed exactly
- Alternative computational paths can be explored systematically

**Graceful Degradation**: System behavior degrades gracefully under various failure modes:
- Missing entities → Clear error messages with suggested alternatives
- Type mismatches → Automatic type conversion suggestions
- Process failures → Fallback to alternative approaches
- Goal infeasibility → Partial progress reporting and goal refinement suggestions

### 6.3 Extensibility and Adaptation

**Dynamic Process Registration**: New computational capabilities can be added **at runtime**:
```python
# Add new analysis capability
@CallableRegistry.register("advanced_sentiment_analysis")
def analyze_sentiment_with_context(
    text_content: str,           # "@document_entity.content"
    context_information: str,    # "@context_entity.background"
    model_configuration: str     # "@model_entity.parameters"
) -> Entity:
    # Implementation of new analysis approach
    return SentimentAnalysis(...)

# System automatically incorporates into process selection
```

**Goal Evolution**: Goals can be **refined and extended** based on discoveries during execution:
```python
def adaptive_goal_refinement(current_goal: Goal,
                           new_information: Entity) -> Goal:
    # Analyze how new information changes goal feasibility

**Cross-Domain Transfer**: Information patterns learned in one domain **automatically transfer** to related domains through structural similarity detection.

## 7. Conclusion: Practical Information-Theoretic Computing

The Entity Component System implementation demonstrates that **Goal-Directed Typed Processes** can be realized through practical software engineering approaches without sacrificing theoretical rigor. By implementing information-theoretic principles through **engineered constraints** rather than abstract mathematics, we achieve:

**Theoretical Soundness**: The implementation preserves all the essential properties of the theoretical framework - information monotonicity, provenance tracking, goal-directed behavior, and hallucination prevention.

**Engineering Practicality**: The system uses familiar patterns (ECS, registry systems, type validation) that integrate naturally with existing software development practices.

**Computational Efficiency**: Careful design choices enable the system to scale to realistic problem sizes while maintaining the theoretical guarantees.

**Extensibility**: The architecture supports **organic growth** - new capabilities can be added without requiring fundamental architectural changes.

**Key Insights**:

**Information as First-Class Citizen**: By treating information itself as a **versioned, structured, traceable resource**, we create computational systems that naturally tend toward reliability and correctness.

**Constraints Enable Capabilities**: The **restrictive constraints** (pointer-only composition, automatic versioning, provenance tracking) don't limit system capabilities - they **enable new capabilities** by eliminating entire classes of errors.

**Emergent Intelligence**: When individual components follow simple **information-theoretic principles**, complex **intelligent behaviors** emerge naturally from their interactions without requiring explicit programming.

**Practical Implementation Path**: Complex theoretical frameworks become **implementable** when expressed through **concrete engineering patterns** that embody the underlying principles.

This implementation provides a **production-ready foundation** for building reliable, goal-directed AI agents that maintain **mathematical rigor** while operating in **real-world computational environments**. The combination of entity versioning, callable registries, and automatic provenance tracking creates a **new paradigm** for AI system architecture that prioritizes **information integrity** and **causal transparency** as fundamental design principles.

The framework establishes that **reliable AI agency** is achievable through careful **information architecture** rather than through increasingly complex model training or reward engineering. By building systems that **cannot hallucinate** and **must track causality**, we create a path toward AI systems that are both **powerful** and **trustworthy**.
